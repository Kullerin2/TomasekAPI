Hi
Here is description of my journey with this task
Journal :

Skip the first 14 steps, I did not understand what issue means exactly and made something different as requested


1. I started to watch what is terraform
2. I register my secondary email in microsoft for getting azure subscription
3. Install and playing with terraform
4. Playing with Azure API resource, APIM, API,... watching guides
5. Download of API example 
6. Develop the API with .Net core
7. Read guide for MemoryCache use / basic usage
8. Read guide for async/await usage in API. not used, too complicated for now to correct understanding
9. Postman installation and testing in localhost
10. Registred in GITHub, created repository https://github.com/Kullerin/TomasekAPI
11. Created the Resource, APIM in Azure by hand
12. First publish the API to Azure and testing
13. Initial run of ResourceGroup, APIM and API with Terraform
14. Initial commit to GitHub, my account is supposed now
Time cost about 12 hour

DEADLOCK :
I am thinking and trying to solve problem how to create stub for API, but also how to publish the API by Terraform, and it's not possible

NEED ADVISE, how to continue

AND NOW I found, that i solved different assignment
Why?
a) I though, that the API should be like https://petstore.swagger.io/v2/pet/findByStatus , but not using that
b) I though, that i should create API with .net core and script in terraform for automatic create and publishing of it
c) Too much new thinks, so it was hard to imagine what is the request

SO Lets begin again
What is the assignment ?
Create API on Azure, where the https://petstore.swagger.io/v2/pet/findByStatus will be used as a source
Define Inbound policy which will transpose the result and make authentication and Cache inside

1) Creating new Testing API, for correct definition of the Inbound, I saw the tons of guides, where inbounds
2) Playing with inbound steps - realizing that swagger is GET, and we should make a POST
3) Implementing the usage of CACHE
4) Testing the test API with Postman, with Azure API Test section
5) Using complete and tested Inbound policy in terraform script
6) Testing terraform - new API created, new operation , new operation_policy
7) Found that subscription_required = "false" not needed
8) Writing readme
9) GIT hub account suspended due to usage of 3party solution for terraform, has to create new account
10) New GIT account, Journey writing
11) Commit, Push, 

Time Cost - 5 hours
